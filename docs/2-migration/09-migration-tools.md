# Tools for Claiming Process
This guide explains how to sign a message and complete the ZEN token claim process using official Horizen tools.

## Overview of Tools
**Step 1: Sign a Message**

Use one of the following tools to generate a signed message:
- [Sphere Wallet](#sphere-wallet)
- [Ledger Signing Tool](#ledger-signing-tool)
- [Private Key Signing Tool](#private-key-signing-tool)

**Step 2: Submit the Claim**

Use either:
- [Claim Page](#claim-page)
- [CLI](#cli)

## Sign Message
Before claiming, you must generate a valid signature using the message format:
<!-- Update prefix -->
```
"ZENCLAIM" + destinationAddress
```
For example:

```
ZENCLAIM0x1B9aCc8d2c9e20aC2e78904e6f123f2D22Dd2A8w
```


> Note: For testing purposes on testnet, the message prefix will be `ZT1CLAIM`, so for example `ZT1CLAIM0x1B9aCc8d2c9e20aC2e78904e6f123f2D22Dd2A8w`


This section outlines how to do this using the three available tools.

### Sphere Wallet
If you have your seed phrase, you can use [Sphere](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen/releases/tag/desktop-v1.22.0) to sign a message.

1. Open Sphere and import your seed phrase (if not already imported).
2. Verify that your wallet addresses and balances are correct.
3. To generate a signature, click on this icon in your Sphere wallet and enter this message: `"ZENCLAIM" + destinationAddress`; Example: `ZENCLAIM0x1B9aCc8d2c9e20aC2e78904e6f123f2D22Dd2A8w`. <!-- Update prefix -->

4. Click **Create Signature**. This will be used in the claim process.


### Ledger Signing Tool
If your funds are stored on a Ledger hardware wallet, use the [Ledger Signing Tool](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ledger-signing-tool).

> **Note**: For security, we recommend downloading the tool and running it offline. Download the static files [here](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ledger-signing-tool/releases/tag/v0.1.0), then open index.html locally. <!-- Update download link -->


**Prerequisites**
- Install both the Bitcoin and Horizen apps on your Ledger device.
- Ensure the Horizen app version is v2.4.1 or higher.

**Signing Instructions**
1. Connect your Ledger device and open the **Horizen** app.
2. Open the Ledger Signing Tool and click **Connect**. Make sure your Ledger device is unlocked, and the Horizen app is open. The Ledger screen will show "Application is ready".

3. Enter the **destination address**. This is the EVM address that will received the migrated ZEN tokens. The "Message to Sign" will auto-populate.

   ![Enter destination address](/img/migration-tools/ledger-2.png)

4. Enter the derivation path for the ZEN address being claimed from. 

    To find this value, open the Ledger Live app and go to the account, click **Edit Account &rarr; Advanced**, and note the `freshAddressPath`.

6. Click **Sign Message** and confirm the message on your Ledger device. Copy the generated signature.

### Private Key Signing Tool
If you have direct access to your private key, use the [Private Key Signing Tool](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/signing-tool-private-key).

> **Note**: For security, we recommend downloading the tool and running it offline. Download the static files [here](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/signing-tool-private-key/releases/tag/v0.0.1-ZT1CLAIM), then open index.html locally. <!-- Update download link -->

![Private Key Signing Tool](/img/migration-tools/private-key-1.png)

1. Enter your **private key** and confirm the ZEN address is correct.

2. Enter the **destination EVM address**. The "Message to Sign" will auto-populate.

3. Click **Sign Message** to generate and copy the signed message.

## Claim Process
Once you have a valid signature, use the claim interface to submit your request.
