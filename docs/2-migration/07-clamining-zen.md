# Claiming ZEN

This section covers the steps to follow to claim old mainchain ZEN balances after the migration.<br/>

## Who needs to execute the manual claim?

Onyl ZEN balances coming from the old ZEND Mainchain will have to be manually claimed.<br/>
If you only had founds on EON Chain, your balances will be automatically moved to the same address in the new chain, and no manual operation will be needed.

## Why is the manual claim needed?

A simple manual claim of the funds is required because the address format on the two chains is different (Bitcoin-format in the old Horizen chain, Ethereum format in the new Horizen chain). The on-chain UTXO structure does not track the original key/address owning it, making impossible an automatic mapping between old and new addresses.

## How to claim

The old mainchain is a Bitcoin-like chain, where funds are locked in multiple cryptographic "boxes" called UTXO.<br/>
To unlock funds, you will need to generate a signature of a specific message with a private key able to "unlock" the corresponding UTXOs.<br/>
The claim will be then performed on-chain, by calling a method on the official Horizen migration contract.<br/>
Here the details about the method call:

### Pay-to-pub-key hash Claim

This is the most common format of UTXO, used for example by the Horizen Sphere Wallet and many other non-custodial wallets.<br/>
The Solidity method to claim this kind of UTXOs is the following:

    function claimP2PKH(address destAddress, bytes memory hexSignature, bytes32 pubKeyX, bytes32 pubKeyY) public 

Parameters details:

- destAddress:  Destination address on Base of the funds to be claimed. 
  This can be generated by any keypair (using the same previous private-key is not mandatory), and can be different from the tx caller)
- hexSignature:  ECDSA/Secp256k1 Signature generated with the private key associated with the UTXOs to claim, of the following message:<br/>
  “ZENCLAIM” + destination_address 
  (destination_address on Base, represented in the hex form , with “0x” prefix. No space has to be inserted after “ZENCLAIM” string).
- pubKeyX and pubKeyY: X and Y part of the public key associated to the same private key that generated the signature and owned the UTXOs.
  Must be always sent in the uncompressed form, and split into the two parts (X represents the first 32 bytes, Y the other 32 bytes).
