# Preparing old chain nodes

> :warning: **This step is for node operators, no action is required for ZEN holders** 

A proper version of ZEND and EON will be released to support the migration.
In particular:

- EON 1.5 will be released with following features:
    - Hardfork configured to Stop backward transfers to the mainchain
    - Dump support via command-line
- ZEND 6 will be released with following features:
    - Hardfork configured to stop forward transfers to EON and sidechain creation


Releases will be published in advance as usual, to let operators to update the nodes.

The majority of the node operators of both chains will need to update their nodes before the planned hard forks dates.
