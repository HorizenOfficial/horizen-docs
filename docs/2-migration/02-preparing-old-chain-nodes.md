# Preparing old chain nodes

A proper version of ZEND and EON will be released to support the migration.
In particular:

- EON 1.5 will be released with following features:
    -- Hardfork configured to Stop backward transfers to the mainchain
    -- Dump support via command-line
- ZEND 6 will be released with following features:
    -- Hardfork configured to stop forward transfers and sidechain creation
    -- Dump support via command-line

Releases will be published in advance as usual, to let operators to update the nodes.

The majority of the node operators of both chain will need to update their nodes before the planned hard forks dates.
