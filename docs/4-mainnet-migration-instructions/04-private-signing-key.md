# Private Key Signing Tool

If you have direct access to your private key, use the [Private Key Signing Tool](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/horizen-migration-signing-tool-private-key/releases/latest).

If you only have your seed phrase, you'll need to derive your private key using a tool such as [Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases/tag/0.5.6). For security, **always use this tool offline** by downloading the `bip39-standalone.html` file from the official GitHub release. After downloading, open the file in a web browser with your internet connections disabled. Be sure to select the **Coin** to "ZEN - Horizen" in the dropdown.

> **Note**: For security, we recommend downloading the tool and running it offline. Download and extract the static files [here](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/horizen-migration-signing-tool-private-key/releases/latest), then open `index.html` locally.
