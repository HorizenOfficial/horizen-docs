# CLI Tool

The CLI tool provides functionality for signing and verifying messages. It also supports claiming tokens from ZEN addresses, both standard transparent and multisignature addresses (see [below](#cli-tool-1)). The CLI can be used directly from the command line or imported as a module into a Node.js project.

#### Available Commands

- **`signmessage`**
  Sign a message with a ZEN private key.

- **`verifymessage`**
  Verify a signed message against a ZEN address.

For detailed usage examples and other supported commands, refer to the [GitHub README](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/horizen-migration-cli/tree/1.0.0-ZENCLAIM).

## Claim Page

   - The signed message should have already been created, if you havenâ€™t done this yet please go to the following section to generate a signature: [Message Signing Instructions](#message-signing-instructions).
   - Paste the **signed message** into the signature field. 
   - **Enter the same destination address used in the message singing step.**
