1st Token: WZEN (Wrapped ZEN)
2nd Token: ZEN (Native ZEN)

Refer to the image below for visual guidance

This swap is free and converts your wrapped ZEN back to native ZEN that will migrate automatically.

2. Remove ZEN from Liquidity Pools
If your ZEN is providing liquidity in any DeFi pools:

Remove all ZEN from liquidity pools immediately
Withdraw your ZEN to your regular wallet
3. Bridge Out Any Non-ZEN Assets
If you have other tokens (USDC, USDT, WBTC, etc.) on EON:

Bridge them out to Ethereum mainnet or other networks
Only ZEN will migrate to Base all other tokens will be lost
4. Remove ZEN from Smart Contracts
If your ZEN is locked in any smart contracts or DApps:

Withdraw it to your regular wallet immediately
ZEN in smart contracts will NOT migrate
5. Move ZEN from EON Multisig Wallets
If your ZEN is in a multisig wallet:

Move it to a regular wallet (EOA address)
ZEN in multisig wallets will not automatically migrate
6. If You Have Staked ZEN on EON
