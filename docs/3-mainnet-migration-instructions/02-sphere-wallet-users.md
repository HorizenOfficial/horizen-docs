4. Click **Create Signature**. This will generate a signature for you, save this as it will be used in the claim process.

   > **Note:** _if you have several addresses with balances to claim in your wallet, you need to repeat the procedure for every address._

5. Proceed to the [Claim Page](/mainnet-migration-instructions/claim-page).
