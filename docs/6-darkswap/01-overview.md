# About DarkSwap 

## 1. Overview

### What is DarkSwap?

DarkSwap is the first application on Horizen’s L3 privacy stack. It is a modular privacy infrastructure powered by Singularity. Designed specifically for DeFi traders, DarkSwap enables users to execute trades without exposure to MEV bots, sandwich attacks, or slippage. All onchain footprints including assets traded, price and volume are hidden from explorers and mempools. 
DarkSwap isn’t about privacy for privacy’s sake — it’s about protecting traders from being exploited by the system and provides better onchain execution.

### Why is DarkSwap important?

In a DeFi landscape flooded with alpha leaks, MEV bots, sandwich attacks, and front-running, DarkSwap acts as a frontline defense to protect users from:

- MEV bots exploiting network latency.
- Sandwich attacks that increase trading costs.
- Front-running tactics that harm regular traders.
