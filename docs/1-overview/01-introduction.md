# What is Horizen

Horizen is a privacy-first appchain built to make privacy simple, powerful, and accessible for everyday apps. With upgraded tokenomics, ZEN brings better liquidity, lower costs, and seamless access to privacy tools across Base and the Ethereum ecosystem.

Horizen is designed to be the natural evolution of both the previous Horizen's chains, ZEND Mainchain and EON: their ZEN balances have been migrated into an ERC-20 smart contract on BASE chain.<br/>
[Check here for all the details about the migration](../2-migration/01-overview.md).
