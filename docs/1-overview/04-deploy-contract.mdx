title: "Deploy a contract"
---

## Prerequisites
- A wallet with some testnet ETH on Horizen Testnet

## Deploy a contract using Foundry

Foundry is a Rust-based toolset for Ethereum development that helps developers manage dependencies, compile projects, run tests, deploy contracts, and interact with blockchains via the command line interface.
Open a terminal and run the following commands to install Foundry:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

```bash
foundryup
```

Next we will create a project with Foundry. We will start with the basic Counter contract Foundry provides. Run the following command to create a Foundry project:
```bash
forge init hello_horizen && cd hello_horizen
```

After this we will compile our smart contracts using the following command:
```bash
forge build
```

Next we will deploy the counter contract located at ``src/Counter.sol``  using the ``forge create`` command. We would also need the [RPC_URL](./03-rpc.mdx) and the ``PRIVATE_KEY`` of the funded wallet to deploy the contracts. Use the following command to deploy your contracts:
```bash
forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter \
--rpc-url https://horizen-testnet.rpc.caldera.xyz/http \
--private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

## Deploy a contract using Hardhat

Hardhat is a flexible and extensible development environment for Ethereum software. It helps you write, test, debug, and deploy your smart contracts with ease, whether you’re building a simple prototype or a complex production system.

You can initialize a hardhat project with the following commands
```bash
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
npx hardhat --init
```

And then compile the project using this command
```bash
npx hardhat build
```

In the `hardhat.config.ts` file, we will need to add configuration for Horizen:
```js
networks: {
    horizen: {
      type: "http",
      url: "https://horizen-testnet.rpc.caldera.xyz/http",
      accounts: ["<PRIVATE_KEY>"],
    },
  },
```

And then you can use the following command to deploy the `Counter` smart contract on Horizen testnet
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts --network horizen
```
