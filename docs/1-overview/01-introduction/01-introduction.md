# What is Horizen

Horizen is the next generation EVM chain specifically tailored to building zero-knowledge (ZK) dApps.

Horizen is designed to be the natural evolution of both the previous Horizen's chains, ZEND Mainchain and EON: their ZEN balances have been migrated into an ERC-20 smart contract on BASE chain.<br/>
[Check here for all the details about the migration](../../2-migration/01-overview.md).
